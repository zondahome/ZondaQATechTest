# ZondaQATechTest
Technical test template for QA candidates


Introduction
Congratulations on making it to the QA Technical Exam! Firstly you will want to do a little setup to get the project up and running. This repository contains a basic React app which you will be used as the basis for the test, and a JSON data file.  Please go to [here](web/README.md) for instructions on how to setup the app on your local machine. 

The provided app has NodeJS API which will serve data from a JSON data file and display it in the UI.  Once you have set up the application the real test begins!

During the interview process we will have explained to you that we currently have very little in place in the way of testing and test process.  In this assessment, we will evaluate your expertise in crafting a test plan from scratch. As a QA engineer, your role is pivotal in ensuring the reliability and performance of software applications. This exam presents you with the opportunity to showcase your skills in creating a test plan that outlines the scope, objectives, test levels, and resources necessary for effective testing.


## Exam Overview:

Your primary task in this examination is to develop a test plan for a basic software application. This test plan will serve as a blueprint for evaluating the application's functionality, performance, and data quality.

### 1. Planning Test Case/Acceptance Criteria

The candidate should write Acceptance Criteria/Test Cases for the main components of the application: 
* Filter field input
* Sorting
* Result validation

The test cases can be provided in any format/notation the candidate prefers, the objective is to provide AC that could have been written/approved by Product on the original.

As part of this, the candidate should also create a test plan outlining: 
* Test case priority 
* The scope (and any limit)
* Resources/timescales required to implement.

### 2. ImplementTest Case/Acceptance Criteria

The candidate should create the tests from (1.2) either in the provided code base utilising the existing tools, or using a different tool of their choosing i.e. chose the tool you would employ if you were a successful applicant.  The tests themselves will be covered during the follow-up interview where you will be expected to demo them.

### 3. Risk Assessment

The candidate should also provide a brief risk assessment.  Risk assessment could cover:
* Risk Identification: i.e. problems with Design, maintainability, performance...etc
* Risk Severity: assign rating to identified risks in (1)
* Risk Priority: assign rating to identified risks in (1)

### 4. Submission

1. Submit your solution to `1 Planning Test Case/Acceptance Criteria` and `3. Risk Assessment` via email to either David or Graeme. 
2. If you have created test cases to the code base in `2 ImplementTest Case/Acceptance Criteria` please submit this ahead of the interview by creating your own repository (ensuring it is public) and add a link to your email.  Other-wise this will be covered and demo during the 2nd interview. 

### Assessment Criteria: 

You will be assessed on the thoroughness, clarity, and effectiveness of your test plan. We will consider factors such as your ability to identify potential risks, plan test levels, define objectives, and allocate the appropriate resources.

1. Technical Exam Feedback

After we have received your submission we will schedule a follow-up interview where we will go through your submission and:
* Ask the candidate to explain their approach to testing the provided scenario.
* Ask the candidate to go over test coverage, test prioritisation...etc
* Ask the candidate how they would have worked with developers to address/action the AC/bugs 

In the interest of continual improvement, we may ask you what changes they would make to the provided exam.

### Time Limit: 

It is up to you how long you spend on the task but we recommend approximately 1-2 hours. Please read all the way through this document before starting as there are important details below.

### Instructions: 

Read the provided information carefully and utilize your QA engineering skills to craft a test plan that demonstrates your competence in ensuring the software's quality. Your plan should address the following key aspects:

* Scope: Define the scope of testing, specifying what will and will not be tested.
* Objectives: Clearly state the objectives of the testing process and what you aim to achieve.
* Test Levels: Outline the various test levels that need to be performed.
* Resources: Identify the resources required for successful testing, including personnel, tools, and equipment.
